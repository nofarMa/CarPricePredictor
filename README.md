Overview

CarPricePredictor is a machine learning-based application for predicting car prices using various features such as year, manufacturer, engine capacity, and mileage. Designed to streamline price estimation, it processes user inputs and delivers precise predictions via a trained ElasticNet regression model.

Features

Accurate Predictions: Estimates car prices based on key attributes.
Data Processing: Cleans and prepares input data to match model requirements.
User-Friendly: Accepts simple inputs for easy use in real-world scenarios.
Robust Model: Utilizes ElasticNet for balanced L1/L2 regularization.
Tech Stack

Language: Python
Libraries:
scikit-learn: For model training and prediction.
pandas: For data manipulation.
numpy: For numerical operations.
